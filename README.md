## What is the GodClock

Well if you ever wished you had more hours in the day,
the Component allows you to set the amount of hours you want in a day and it ensures
the set hours run in 24hours.

## Where can I see it

There is a deployed verision on netlify with 30 hours in a day [HERE](https://silly-lewin-bb3fa7.netlify.app/)

## Todo

[ ] Create Input component to allow users to set the number of hours in a day they want.

[ ] Write Unit Tests.

[ ] Setup much better styling and project structure.

[ ] Setup better attributions and notes on the site [HERE](https://silly-lewin-bb3fa7.netlify.app/).

[ ] Extend GodClock to count to set hours i.e (00:00 - 30:00) instead of only having the option to run 30 hours in 24hrs i.e (00:00 - 24:00)


## Future Settings Todo

1. choose to run 30hrs in a day or sync
2. sync real life events with calendar so you know when it falls on your virtual one
3. Have option to choose reset date and time
4. have option to choose if it resets every day 
i.e for case when you run 6hrs as 24hrs, 
you could in theory run every four days ahead every day

- Runproper validations i.e you cannot set a date in the future as a starting date
