## The origins of the GodClock

This is as a result of a [tweet by ola](https://twitter.com/codngr/status/1406949055658442760),
It just kept nagging me so, over two hours of my life gone, but worth it.

## What is the GodClock

Well if you ever wished you had more hours in the day, 
the Component allows you to set the amount of hours you want in a day and syncs it to 24hours.

## Where can I see it

There is a deployed verision on netlify with 30 hours in a day [HERE](https://silly-lewin-bb3fa7.netlify.app/)


## Todo

[ ] Create Input component to allow users to set the number of hours in a day they want.

[ ] Write Unit Tests.

[ ] setup much better styling and project structure.

[ ] setup better attributions and notes on the site [HERE](https://silly-lewin-bb3fa7.netlify.app/).
